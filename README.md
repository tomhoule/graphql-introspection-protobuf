# graphql-introspection-protobuf

Protocol Buffer v3 definitions for GraphQL schema introspection.

These definitions should match the shape of the JSON object returned from a GraphQL API presented with the standard introspection query.

The authoritative source for these definitions is the [GraphQL spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/master/spec/Section%204%20--%20Introspection.md).
